# language-prediction
An AI that TRIES to guess the language of a word

Given an image(the visualization of a word) it will output the language it thinks it is in

The languages are:
- English
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Japenese

## Neural Network
I used pytorch to create the neural network

The Neural Net is a feed forward network It has 390(15x26) inputs, 1 hidden layers with 6 neurons each and 6 outputs

## Date
I used my own data made from each languages dictionary
